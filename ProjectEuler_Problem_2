// After much tinkering, I got the Fibonacci sequence (up to 4e6) to print properly under
// the 'z' value.
// I played with using 'console.log("X: " + x + "|Y: " + y + "|Z: " + z);' as line_12 
// in order to see if the numbers were coming out properly across the board. Interestingly
// enough, at times certain variables were outputting the proper, expected values without all
// variables being correct. I don't know how it was broke-working like that.

function fibonacci(){
    var x = 1;
    var y = 0;
    var z = 1;
    for (count=0; z<(4e6); count++) {
    console.log(z);
    y = x
    x = z
    z = x + y;
    }
}
