// Project Euler Problem_2: http://projecteuler.net/problem=2

// After much tinkering, I got the Fibonacci sequence (up to 4e6) to print properly under
// the 'x' value.
// I played with using 'console.log("X: " + x + "|Y: " + y + "|Z: " + z);' as line_12 
// in order to see if the numbers were coming out properly across the board. Interestingly
// enough, at times certain variables were outputting the proper, expected values without all
// variables being correct. I don't know how it was broke-working like that.

function fibonacci(){
    var x = 1;
    var y = 0;
    var z = 1;
    for (count=0; z<(4e6); count++) {
    console.log(z);
    y = x
    x = z
    z = x + y;
    }
}
fibonacci();

// After solving the problem up to the step posted above, the final solution came quickly:

function fibonacci(){
    var x = 1;
    var y = 0;
    var z = 1;
    var sum = 0;
    for (count=1; z<(4e6); count++) {
    if (z%2 === 0) {
        console.log(z);
        sum = sum + z;
        }
    y = x;
    x = z;
    z = x + y;
    }
console.log("The sum of these numbers is: " +sum);
}
fibonacci();

// I"m sure this is a long way of going about writing this program, but it's what I've got. -lh
